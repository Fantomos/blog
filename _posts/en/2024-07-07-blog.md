I'm going to talk about how the website you're currently on is made. 

I wanted to have a place where I could write about my projects and keep a memory of them. Even though I made several websites in the past, this one is really simple : I only needed a blog, in other words, some static pages for my new posts and a way to navigate between them. 

That's why I decided to use Jekyll to build the website and Github Page to host it. Having built another site using the same technologies during a previous job, I had some experience with these tools.

## Jekyll : A static site generator
A lot of similar tools exist now, but I still use **Jekyll** because of how simple and supported it is. 
Jekyll is an open source static site generator written in Ruby. It renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by any web server.

That's mean I can quickly add new contents by just creating a new Mardown text file.

## Github Pages : A free hosting service
**GitHub Pages** offers to host for free a Jekyll website in one of your repository. The website is then published and can be accessed at *username.github.io* or at your own domain name. 

As you've probably already noticed, I choose the later option, because I already own the beniserv.fr domain for my home server and various services.

## Chirpy : A beautiful Jekyll theme
I could have built the site from scratch, but firstly I'm not a good designer and secondly, it would have taken me months of work. I didn't want to spend that much time and end up with an average looking blog. 

So I started looking for an already existing theme and I fell in love with the **Chirpy** theme by **Cotes Chung**. It was exactly what I needed and imagined. 
It had most of the functionalitied required for a nice blog (and even more) : posts, tags, category, search function, archive, ...

And because the theme is really well-made, it only takes a few minutes to get started.

## Multi-language : Implementing Polyglot
The only problem I had with this theme was the lack of multi-language support. 

It is important for me to be able to write my posts in English but also in French. And I wanted a way for the reader to easily switch between one language and the other.

Hopefully there is a Jekyll plugin this called **Polyglot**. So I integrated it into my site after having made some adjustments to the theme and added a language selector in the side menu.

Eventually in the future, I would clean up my code, and create a Pull Request to the Chirpy theme with my changes, as I'm sure multi-language support could interest a lot of developers and bloggers.
